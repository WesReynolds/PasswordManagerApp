# PasswordManagerApp
This is a password manager application. This application stores all data on your machince, so there is no way for adversaries to obtain your important account information without obtaining your machine. No data is stored on a server.

The application is written using Python 3.6. Alongside the default Python libraries, I made use of the free open source Python libraries: Kivy, Pickle, Pyperclip, and Ctypes. The application was packaged for Windows 10 using PyInstaller and Inno Setup Compiler

Download "Password Manager Setup" for a Windows 10 exectuable that will allow you to install the application onto your machine. When running the installer, you may get a security warning. You can ignore the security warning if you trust me :)
