# PasswordManagerApp
This is a password manager application. The application is written using Python 3.6. Alongside the default Python libraries, I made use of the free open source Python libraries: Kivy, Pickle, Pyperclip, and Ctypes. The application was packaged for Windows 10 using PyInstaller and Inno Setup Compiler
