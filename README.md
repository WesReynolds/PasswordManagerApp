# PasswordManagerApp
This is a password manager application. The application is written using Python 3.6. Alongside the default Python libraries, I made use of the free open source Python libraries: Kivy, Pickle, Pyperclip, and Ctypes. The application was packaged for Windows 10 using PyInstaller and Inno Setup Compiler

Download "Password Manager Setup" for a Windows 10 exectuable that will allow you to install the application onto your machine. When running the installer, you may get a security warning. You can ignore the security warning if you trust me :)
